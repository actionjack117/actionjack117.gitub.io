# Jack Plahutnik
I'm Jack. Your friendly neighborhood Jack. Still chasing the dream.  This showcases my work in C# (console and WPF). This is not the end of my dream, but the beginning. 😴💭💤🧚‍♀️🧞‍♂️🦄🏔️
## Final Project

### Overview

### Screenshots
> [!NOTE]
> This project has music which isn't here for you to hear.

The three things I am most proud of in this project are:
* Audio
* All original code (no AI)
* First time using XAML and WPF
