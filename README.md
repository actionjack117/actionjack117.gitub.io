# Jack Plahutnik
I'm just your friendly neighborhood Jack. Still chasing the dream.  This showcases my work in C# (console and WPF). This is not the end of my journey, but the beginning. 😴💭💤🧚‍♀️🧞‍♂️🦄🏔️
## Final Project

### Overview
My game is a parody of Jeopardy. I had two fun categories, one serious, and one that is a curveball for everyone that isn't me.

> [!NOTE]
> This project has music which isn't here for you to hear.

The three things I am most proud of in this project are:
* Audio
* All original code (no AI)
* First time using XAML and WPF
